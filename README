run build.py to build the DyeScreening project on your local machine. 

build.py will create the data and results folders, where all files genereated throughout the build will be kept. 

the raw_data folder contains the raw data. This data is the "purest". 

the data folder contains all the enriched data and the raw data. All data files in the data folder should be considered to be enriched in some way. 

each experiment in experiment.py contains a seperate model. Each model is unique in either the data it learns from or the machine learning algorithm it uses to learn. 

each model is evaluated using code from evaluation.py.

the result of all model evaluation is stored in the results folder.
